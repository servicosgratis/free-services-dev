# About Free Services - English
[Free Services](https://freeservices.dev) is a catalog of free services for developers, including **free-tier** options on SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS platforms as well as **self-hosted** **open-source** solutions that can be installed and run locally or on private servers. Originally created in 2000, Free Services was one of the first sites dedicated to listing free tools on the internet, and it is now being revamped to meet the needs of today’s developers, evolving into a fully open-source project.

## Purpose
This project aims to make free tools more accessible for development, testing, and deployment, supporting the developer community with options that are both accessible and easy to implement. Our goal is not only to list services with free tiers but also to promote open-source alternatives for independent use.

## Contributing
The developer community is encouraged to contribute to expand and keep the catalog up to date. If you know of a free service or tool that isn’t listed, feel free to open a pull request or issue.

## How to Contribute
- **Add services**: Follow the contribution guidelines and provide the service name, type of free offering, and the official link.
- **Improve descriptions**: Suggest enhancements to service descriptions so other developers can quickly understand the purpose and benefits of each item.
- **Report outdated services**: Help keep the catalog relevant by submitting updates to remove deprecated services or fix broken links.
- **Translations**: We are building a base in both Portuguese and English, with plans to expand to multiple languages in the future. Help with translations is welcome!
